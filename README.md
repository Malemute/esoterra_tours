# esoterra_tours
This script creates a site on tours by means of Django.

# Quickstart

The script requires Python 3.7 or later version installed. Then use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.7:

```bash

$ python main.py --url <incoming url> # possibly requires call of python3 executive instead of just python

```
If the script is called with no parameters, a user can input the link from the console

# Output Example

```
Битлинк = bit.ly/3ci09sP
```
To count clicks:
```
Total clicks = 7
```
